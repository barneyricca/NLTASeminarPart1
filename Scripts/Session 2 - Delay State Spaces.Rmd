Mostly focus on the classical delay state space approach:

Embedding via constant delays (because some software still expects this). 

# Linear Pendulum
Use pendulum to show the importance of delay (and other) choices. Some things stay the same and some don't. How to choose? (Effectively, do a sensitivity analysis by varying parameters.)

Dimension choice (via theory and via Takens), delay criteria from MI, FNN, Theiler windows, radius?

Impact of added exogenous noise
